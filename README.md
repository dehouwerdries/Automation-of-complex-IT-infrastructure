## Structure

**/POC's**: All of our Proof of Concepts and relevant files can be found here.

**/Sprint Deliverables**: Houses a copy of the paper at the end of each sprint. This wasn't done consequently, so only Sprints 1 and 3 and the final version are there.

**/StackStorm Infrastructure**: An (unfinished) Terraform script to automatically deploy StackStorm.

**/Weekly Status Report**: A brief status report of every academic week, including timesheets.

**/tools**: Contains a folder of every (non-StackStorm) tool that was worked out in the paper. Mostly used as a comparison to StackStorm.

## Usage

If you'd like to deploy the POC's, see the final paper in "Sprint Deliverables" for documentation.
