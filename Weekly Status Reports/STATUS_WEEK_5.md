## Status
Dries ran into some minor issues with getting Chef up, but some extra hours managed to fix this problem. We've finished all our POC's and are ready for the presentation. This last week will be purely for finishing touches and the article/pitch/presentation. Most of our documentation is also ready, only POC 4 still needs to be documented.
